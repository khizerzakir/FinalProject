## Overview

Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. Its impacts know no borders and all members of society are being affected. To tackle this challenge, there is a constant need for the development of sustainable solutions. One impact of rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns is the occurrence of more large-scale wildfires. These wildfires damage/destroy ecosystems and pose significant health risks to human beings. The risk of fire is increased by warm and dry weather. This calls for continuous monitoring and dissemination of atmospheric and weather indicators that can help track and study wildfire conditions over different regions.
We propose the development of a climate-related application; ‘Ctrl+F (Fire)’ that allows users to locate and visualise wildfires. Additionally, the users can use the application to check atmospheric metrics such as temperature and precipitation, as they are pertinent to forecasting wildfires.
