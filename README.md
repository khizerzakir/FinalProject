## Overview

Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. Its impacts know no borders and all members of society are being affected. To tackle this challenge, there is a constant need for the development of sustainable solutions. One impact of rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns is the occurrence of more large-scale wildfires. These wildfires damage/destroy ecosystems and pose significant health risks to human beings. The risk of fire is increased by warm and dry weather. This calls for continuous monitoring and dissemination of atmospheric and weather indicators that can help track and study wildfire conditions over different regions.
We propose the development of a climate-related application; ‘Ctrl+F (Fire)’ that allows users to locate and visualise wildfires. Additionally, the users can use the application to check atmospheric metrics such as temperature and precipitation, as they are pertinent to forecasting wildfires.

## Components
### Jupyter Notebook
Temperature

### CDS Toolbox
#### Precipitation

Application 1:
Select a month and year and then select a European country. The selection then returns a time series of the monthly average precipitation.

Application 2: 
Select the year to display the mean precipitation and then draw the desired area to produce a time series. This tool has some errors and does not display the time series. In future works, we aim to complete this application and get it fully operational.
